Hi <%= @coach.first_name %>

A new user named <%= @user.first_name %> just choose you to be his coach on techcare !
The first thing to do is to welcome him and to start analysing his first dataset.

It is very important than <%= @user.first_name %> becomes as soon as possible aware of:
- His weaknesses (nutrition, sedentarity etc.)
- What should he has to do in practice (reduce food rations, food education etc.)
- How long he has to achieve its goals

<%= link_to "Look at #{@user.first_name} profil", users_url(@locale) %>

Don't forget to keep in touch with your trainees because it the most significant factor to improve your users' behavior.

Take care of yourself !
